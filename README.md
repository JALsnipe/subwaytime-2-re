MTA SubwayTime Reverse Engineered
=====================

This is an attempt to repackage the MTA SubwayTime app into a runnable Cordova project.  I've pulled the www folder from the App Store ipa file and have added the necessary plugins to build the app.  Just run `ionic cordova run ios` to install all packages and run the app in the iOS simulator.

I've also included the 1.x and 2.x ipa files in this repo with the DRM stripped with Clutch for reference.
